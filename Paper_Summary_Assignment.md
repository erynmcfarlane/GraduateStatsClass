# Research Paper Methods Simulation and Data Analysis - worth 30% - Due week 7 (Oct 29)

Objective: This assignment aims to deepen your understanding of research methodologies and statistical analysis by reading a published scientific paper, summarizing the methods and statistical techniques, simulating data according to your interpretation of the methods, and analyzing the simulated data using appropriate statistical techniques.

This assignment can be done individually, or in groups. If it's done in a group, everyone in the group will get the same grade. 

Instructions:
## Part 1: Paper Selection and Summary (10 Points)
**Paper Selection**
Choose a published research paper from a peer-reviewed journal in your field of study that includes experimental data and statistical analysis. The paper must include:

A detailed description of the experimental design or observational methods.
Statistical analyses (e.g., regression, ANOVA, chi-square tests, etc.).
Note: Choose a paper that allows for reasonable data simulation based on the available methods.

**Methods Summary (5 Points)**
Write a 1 page summary of the paper's methods section, including:

* A clear description of the experimental or observational design.
* A list of variables used in the study (both dependent/response and independent/predictor).
* The statistical tests employed by the authors to analyze their data.

**Statistical Methods Summary (5 Points)**
Write a detailed explanation of the statistical methods used in the paper. Your explanation should include:

* A description of why these methods were chosen based on the research questions.
* Comment on whether you think these were the appropriate methods
* How the statistical results were interpreted by the authors.

## Part 2: Data Simulation and Analysis (20 Points)
**Data Simulation (10 Points)**
Based on your interpretation of the paper's methods, simulate a dataset using R. Your simulated dataset should:

* Include a similar number of variables and observations to the original study.
* Reflect the distributions, relationships, and assumptions described in the paper.
* Provide a detailed explanation of your simulation process, including:
- The steps taken to generate the dataset.
- The rationale behind the choices of distributions, parameters, and sample sizes.

**Data Analysis (10 Points)**
Using the simulated data, conduct the same statistical analyses as the original paper. This analysis should include:

* Proper use of statistical tests.
* Graphical representation of results.
* Interpretation of the results in the context of the original study.

## What to hand in?
* Methods Summary of the original paper
* Statistical Methods Summary of the original paper
* Data Simulation Methods for your simulations/analysis
* Results of your simulation/analysis
* Code used for simulation and analysis

## Note: Some papers publish their code and data when they publish the paper. The point of this assessment is to use the main text of the paper, not that code or data. You will learn much more, and accomplish much more if you do this assignment from the text of the paper only.
