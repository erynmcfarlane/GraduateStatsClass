This is the summative assessment for Biol 5081 (Fall 2025). This has been taken from [Ecology and Evolution](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/20457758/homepage/registeredreports.html) and edited for our purposes

## Breakdown of Grades for this assessment:
60% registered report with a short (2pg) introduction, methods, and specific statistical methods to match a project in the student's thesis. Possibly following [Nature Ecology Evolution](https://www.nature.com/natecolevol/submission-guidelines/registeredreports), or [Ecology and Evolution](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/20457758/homepage/registeredreports.html) guidelines. 
 - this will be broken down into:
    1) draft experimental methods for feedback (10%) - week 4, October 3rd
    2) draft of statistical methods with proposed simulations and methods for feedback (10%) - week 7 - October 31st
    3) feedback on someone else's code (5%) - week 9 - Novmber 14th
    4) draft introduction for feedback (10%) - week 10 - November 21st
   5) full registered report, including introduction, methods, statistical methods, simulations and simulated results (25%) - due during exam period - December 5th.


### Introduction - due Week 10 (21th November) - 2pgs maximum - for initial review and feedback (10%)

A review of the relevant literature that motivates the research question and a full description of the experimental aims and hypotheses. This can be hypothesis testing or hypothesis generating. In either case, a clear gap in the literature should be identified, a clear question should be asked, and predictions should be made. Hypotheses should be stated if appropriate. 

### Methods - due Week 4 (3rd October) - for initial review and feedback (10%)

**These can be handed in in point form!** 

* Full description of proposed sample characteristics, including criteria for data inclusion and exclusion (e.g. outlier extraction). Procedures for objectively defining exclusion criteria due to technical errors or for any other reasons must be specified, including details of how and under what conditions data would be replaced.
* A description of experimental procedures, including randomization and blinding procedures, in sufficient detail to allow another researcher to repeat the methodology exactly. 

### Statistical Methods and Simulated - Due Week 7 (31th October) - for initial review and feedback (10%)

**Theses can all be in R, or, a mix of R code for the simulations and analysis with an English methods paragraph**
Proposed analysis pipeline, including all preprocessing steps, statistical power analyses, and a precise description of all planned analyses, including appropriate correction for multiple comparisons. Any covariates or regressors must be stated. Where analysis decisions are contingent on the outcome of prior analyses, these contingencies must be specified and adhered to. Pre-planned analyses must be reported in the main Results section of Stage 2 submissions. However, unplanned exploratory analyses will be admissible in a separate section of the Results (see below).

NOTE: Estimated effect sizes should be justified with reference to the existing literature. Since publication bias overinflates published estimates of effect size, power analysis must be based on the lowest available or meaningful estimate of the effect size based on an a priori power of 0.9 or higher. 

### Review of someone else's code - Due Week 9 (14th November; 5%)

Students will 1) run someone else's code to see if it works, and 2) comment through the annotation to see if they understand what was done and why. Finally, students will give suggestions on the code/statistical methods for how they think these methods could be improved. 

### Final Assignment - Due during the exam period, December 5th - 25%. 

This will include the Introduction, Methods, Statistical Methods and Results of the simulations. This will be written in English, with accompanying R code to 1) simulate data and 2) analyze data. This paper should have full citations, as well as at least one prediction figure from the simulated data.
