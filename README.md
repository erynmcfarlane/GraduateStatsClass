# GraduateStatsClass
Thinking hard about and developing a stats class for York's graduate biology stats class.
Things will be liberally borrowed from Alex Buerkle's population genetics class, the University of Wyoming Data Science working group, University of Edinburgh's SEED, and other instances that I've written code to help students (i.e. the Flycatcher Field season R bootcamp)

My vague plan for this class is to expose students to a bunch of different methods and ways of thinking about statistics, including lots of code to do the stats, and lots of simulations to change processes and see how the methods respond. 

The plan is not necessarily for the students to be able to apply all of these different methods outside of the class (although that would show a high level of understanding), but for the students to be familiar with all of the methods, understand when they might be valuable, and be able assess how particular models have been used in their field. 

Finally, I will expect students to be able to implement simulations and appropriate analyses for their own thesis work - this will comprise the final project for the class (in four? parts - proposal, inital code, review of someone else's code, and final code).

#### Think about adding seminar series as possible assignment - what are the statistics that were used in the talk to answer the question? Do you have criticisms of the statistics that are used?


Classes I'm considering including:

### 1 Intro to R, intro to model fitting, intro to the learning objectives, and why I think simulations are the best way to learn statistics

### 2 Beastiary of Distributions

### 3 t tests, anovas, chi squareds (i.e. basic parametric comparisons of categories)

### 4 linear regression (i.e. why all models are basically the same again, with more emphasis on quantitative data)

### 5 logistic regression, other generalized linear models

### 6 hierarchical models/mixed effects models

### 7 Published paper assignment day - assignment will have been given well before, and papers chosen

### 8 Work period for statistical tutorials

### 9 Presentations of Tutorials

### 10 Presentations of Tutorials

### 11 Work period for final registered report, including working through feedback

### 12 Work period for final registered report, including working through feedback

## Learning Outcomes
- General statistical literacy - can you read a paper and feel confident that you know what they did, or even better, how to do what they did?
- Phenomenological understanding of how distributions come to be. Why do we expect data to look this way? How do you expect your data to look?
- Writing skills - how do we describe statistical methods? How should we report results?
- Some level of comfort coding in R, or, finding R code and applying it. 

## Potential Breakdown of grades
- 10% attendence and attempts, where code is written in 5/6 of the first lectures. Just need to hand 5 things in to get full marks. They don't need to work, you just need to show good faith effort!
- 20% summarize a published paper, simulate data (and justify the simulations) to match the data as have been describe, write analyses in R to analyze the data as has been described (possibly done in a group?) - due at end of week 7, where week 7 is a work period
- 15% presentation of a tutorial for how to 1) simulate data and 2) analyse the simulated data for a specific method that was not covered in the first 6 weeks (to be done in a group?) - due in class on week 9, where week 8 is a work period - Presented weeks 9 and 10 [I'm not sure this is as useful as the other things, and work periods to do the other things might be a lot more useful?]
- 55% registered report with a short (2pg) introduction, methods, and specific statistical methods to match a project in the student's thesis.
 - this will be broken down into:
    1) draft experimental methods for feedback (10%) - week 4
    2) draft of statistical methods with proposed simulations and methods for feedback (10%) - week 8
    3) draft introduction for feedback (10%) - week 10
   4) full registered report, including introduction, methods, statistical methods, simulations and simulated results (25%) - due during exam period
