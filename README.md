# Graduate Stats Class
Thinking hard about and developing a stats class for York's graduate biology stats class.

**Folks are very welcome to use the material here, but please credit Eryn McFarlane at York University, Toronto, and please let me know via emcfar [at] yorku.ca. I'd be happy to know of any mistakes or suggested changes too!!**

Things will be liberally borrowed from Alex Buerkle's population genetics class, the University of Wyoming Data Science working group, University of Edinburgh's SEED, and other instances that I've written code to help students (i.e. the Flycatcher Field season R bootcamp)

My vague plan for this class is to expose students to a bunch of different methods and ways of thinking about statistics, including lots of code to do the stats, and lots of simulations to change processes and see how the methods respond. 

The plan is not necessarily for the students to be able to apply all of these different methods outside of the class (although that would show a high level of understanding), but for the students to be familiar with all of the methods, understand when they might be valuable, and be able assess how particular models have been used in their field. 

Finally, I will expect students to be able to implement simulations and appropriate analyses for their own thesis work - this will comprise the final project for the class (in four? parts - proposal, initial code, review of someone else's code, and final code).

We might borrow some exercises from [here:](https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/2020/05/26/steal-this-updated-syllabus-for-scientific-writing/)
to help with the writing. 


Classes I'm considering including:

### 1 Intro to R, intro to model fitting, intro to the learning objectives, and why I think simulations are the best way to learn statistics - Sept 10

### 2 Bestiary of Distributions - Sept 17
- this will be the first day where we start simulations

### 3 t tests, anovas, chi squareds (i.e. basic parametric comparisons of categories) - Sept 24
- we will be simulating data to try all of these tests
  
### 4 multiple linear regression (i.e. why all models are basically the same again, with more emphasis on quantitative data) - Oct 1
- we will be simulating data to try all of these tests
- Possibly some work period time for the paper assignment and the RR.
- Also possibly a good time to talk about plots
  
### 5 logistic regression, other generalized linear models - Oct 8
 - everyone should have chosen their paper for methods summary assignment by today, and run it by me!

### 6 hierarchical models/mixed effects models - Oct 22
- we will be simulating data to try all of these tests

### 7 Published paper assignment day - Oct 29
 - assignment will have been given well before, and papers chosen

### 8 AMA statistics day - Nov 5
 - what else do we need to know about?
- ideally to be submitted before hand, basically a Q&A

### 9 Work period for feedback on someone else's code and methods - Nov 12
- This will be following Freddy Hillemann et al's [shinny app](https://github.com/fhillemann/code_review_checklist), related to their [paper](https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/9055/). 

### 10 Work period for final registered report, including working through feedback - Nov 19

### 11 Work period for final registered report, including working through feedback - Nov 26

### 12 Work period for final registered report, including working through feedback - Dec 3

## Learning Outcomes
- General statistical literacy - can you read a paper and feel confident that you know what they did, or even better, how to do what they did?
- Phenomenological understanding of how distributions come to be. Why do we expect data to look this way? How do you expect your data to look?
- Writing skills - how do we describe statistical methods? How should we report results?
- Some level of comfort coding in R, or, finding R code and applying it.
- application of specific statistical methods, and R, to a question you would like to answer

## Potential Breakdown of grades
- 10% attendance and attempts, where code is written in 5/6 of the first lectures. Just need to hand 5 things in to get full marks. They don't need to work, you just need to show good faith effort!
- 30% summarize a published paper, simulate data (and justify the simulations) to match the data as have been describe, write analyses in R to analyze the data as has been described (possibly done in a group?) - due at end of week 7, where week 7 is a work period
- 60% registered report with a short (2pg) introduction, methods, and specific statistical methods to match a project in the student's thesis. Possibly following [Nature Ecology Evolution](https://www.nature.com/natecolevol/submission-guidelines/registeredreports), or [Ecology and Evolution](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/20457758/homepage/registeredreports.html) guidelines. 
 - this will be broken down into:
    1) draft experimental methods for feedback (10%) - week 4
    2) draft of statistical methods with proposed simulations and methods for feedback (10%) - week 8
    3) feedback on someone else's code (5%) - week 9
    4) draft introduction for feedback (10%) - week 10
   5) full registered report, including introduction, methods, statistical methods, simulations and simulated results (25%) - due during exam period
