# GraduateStatsClass
Thinking hard about and developing a stats class for York's graduate biology stats class.
Things will be liberally borrowed from Alex Buerkle's population genetics class, the University of Wyoming Data Science working group, University of Edinburgh's SEED, and other instances that I've written code to help students (i.e. the Flycatcher Field season R bootcamp)

My vague plan for this class is to expose students to a bunch of different methods and ways of thinking about statistics, including lots of code to do the stats, and lots of simulations to change processes and see how the methods respond. 

The plan is not necessarily for the students to be able to apply all of these different methods outside of the class (although that would show a high level of understanding), but for the students to be familiar with all of the methods, understand when they might be valuable, and be able assess how particular models have been used in their field. 

Finally, I will expect students to be able to implement simulations and appropriate analyses for their own thesis work - this will comprise the final project for the class (in four? parts - proposal, inital code, review of someone else's code, and final code).

#### Think about adding seminar series as possible assignment - what are the statistics that were used in the talk to answer the question? Do you have criticisms of the statistics that are used?


Classes I'm considering including:

### 1 Intro to R

### 2 Beastiary of Distributions

### 3 t tests, anovas, chi squareds

### 4 linear regression

### 5 model selection version 1

### 6 hierarchical models/mixed effects models

### 7 machine learning, cross validation, random forest specifically

### 8 sparse models
